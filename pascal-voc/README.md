# Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation on PASCAL VOC

This project has originated from the "Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation" by Berkeley.

* inference.py -- inference for a pre-trained FCN Caffe model
* voc_layers_alexey.py -- python layers for reading input images and ground truth segments

## models
