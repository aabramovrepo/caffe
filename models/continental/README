 How to use AlexNet in Caffe on the own dataset

- paths with training and validation data:

/path/to/imagenet/train/n01440764/n01440764_10026.JPEG
/path/to/imagenet/val/ILSVRC2012_val_00000001.JPEG


- the training and validation input are described in train.txt and val.txt as text listing all the files and their labels.

data/ilsvrc12/train.txt
data/ilsvrc12/val.txt


- set correct paths to training and validation images in the following script:

examples/imagenet/create_imagenet.sh


- create the leveldbs with examples/imagenet/create_imagenet.sh, note that examples/imagenet/ilsvrc12_train_leveldb and examples/imagenet/ilsvrc12_val_leveldb should not exist before the execution.


- compute image mean calling ./examples/imagenet/make_imagenet_mean.sh, it will make data/ilsvrc12/imagenet_mean.binaryproto.


- the network definition is in models/bvlc_reference_caffenet/train_val.prototxt. Note that the fc8 layer needs to be adjusted to the number of classes in the own dataset. batch_size needs to be set there according to the used gpu.


- the solver is defined in models/bvlc_reference_caffenet/solver.prototxt.


- run the training: ./build/tools/caffe train --solver=models/bvlc_reference_caffenet/solver.prototxt


- run the training with weights loaded from the pre-trained AlexNet:

./build/tools/caffe train --solver=models/bvlc_reference_caffenet/solver.prototxt --weights=models/bvlc_alexnet/bvlc_alexnet.caffemodel
